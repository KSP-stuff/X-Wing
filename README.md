X-Wing Final Assembly.png
Put the "X-Wing Final Assembly.json" file in your Workspaces folder located at C:\Users\\\[your user]\AppData\LocalLow\Intercept Games\Kerbal Space Program 2\Saves\SinglePlayer\\\[your save game]\  (The file goes inside the Workspaces folder) (AppData is a hidden folder, if you can't see it you need to make hidden folders visible)

I've also included the meta and png files.  I don't know if they are neccessary, but if they are then they also need to put in the same place as above.
